# Stop Discord Phishing

This will be a NPM Package soon!

A Package that works with the [list of suspicious Domains](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links) which are used for [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) on [Discord](https://discord.com).

This is the official Repository & NPM Package to provide a API to work with those Links.
Feel free to contribute to this Project!
